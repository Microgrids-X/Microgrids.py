    "\n",
    "- Twenty kilometers off the coast of mainland France lies an island of 1,000 inhabitants with no connection to the mainland's power grid.\n",
    "- This interactive demo allows you to investigate several combinations of energy sources to **supply this island with power**, reliably.\n",
    "- Available power sources: \n",
    "    - solar panels and wind turbines\n",
    "    - a dispatchable generator\n",
    "    - a battery (to better balance the load and the available solar power)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveat**: although we tried to put reasonable technical and economic data in this demo, do not take its outcome as a *“perfect scientific truth”* (if such a concept exists) of what should be deployed on this island and at which exact cost. However, this demo can show the positive impact of mixing solar and wind resources. "
